### Introduction

The Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 Coref (PCEDT 2.0 Coref) is a parallel
treebank building upon the original PCEDT 2.0 release and enriching it with the extended
manual annotation of coreference, as well as with an improved automatic annotation of the coreferential
expression alignment.

All the scripts used for the automatic build of the PCEDT 2.0 Coref release are versioned
on [GitHub](https://github.com/ufal/pcedt2.0-coref/).

This documentation provides the most necessary information regarding the treebank. For
