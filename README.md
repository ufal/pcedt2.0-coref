# Coreference extension to Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0

Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 is a parallel treebank of Czech and English comprising 
over 1.2 million running words in almost 50,000 sentences for each part. The treebank contains texts
from the entire Penn Treebank - Wall Street Jurnal section and its Czech translations. On top of it,
it includes three levels of rich linguistic annotation: morphological layer (part-of-speech tags, lemmas),
analytical layer (labeled dependency tree of shallow syntax), and tectogrammatical layer (labeled dependency
tree of deep syntax). The tectogrammatical tree consists only of the content words, however, new nodes
unexpressed in a surface representation may be introduced, e.g., dropped pronouns in Czech. This layer
is also the place where coreference relations are annotated.
